## Overview
This project is primarily written in typescript and it is mainly structured around a server meant for a mobile app which helps users order food items. It makes use of a few notable libraries such as:

- Pnpm (package manager).
- Pnpm monorepo (for managing inter-package dependencies in the workspace).
- Typespec for api documentation.
- Nx for making processes in the monorepo more efficient.

Throughout this styleguide I might call packages in this workspace `package` or `app`, when I do, just know that I mean the same thing. The only 'distinction' between an `app` and a `package` is that an `app` is meant to be run whereas a `package` is typically meant to be imported and used by an `app`.

The main structure of this monorepo is as follows
- Backend
  Package name: @nodejs-template/backend
  Path: ./apps/backend
  Description: This is the main backend server.
  Notable technologies used:
    - hono (as the web server/router).
    - kysely (database client).
- Docs
  Package name: @nodejs-template/docs
  Path: ./apps/docs
  Description: Visual documentation of the whole documentation for the project. The full documentation includes written documentation and the API documentation.
  Notable technologies used:
    - Vitepress (the main documentation tool)
- Media Server
  Package name: @nodejs-template/media-server
  Path: ./apps/media-server
  Description: A makeshift media server meant to mock the main storage solution (which is Cloudinary) and run locally.
  Notable technologies used:
    - hono
- API
  Package name: @nodejs-template/api
  Path: ./packages/api
  Description: This package contains the types and schemas used by other packages in this monorepo. The spec (typespec) files in the docs-openapi package project are used during the build stage to generate typescript types and schemas for this package.
  Notable technologies used:
    - openapi-typescript
- Docs OpenAPI
  Package name: @nodejs-template/docs-openapi
  Path: ./packages/docs-openapi
  Description: API documentation (spec) for the backend. This package is primarily meant to serve as a source of truth for the API endpoints that need to be implemented by the backend.
  Notable technologies used:
    - typespec

### Quick Sidenotes

- To run any script for a specific package your can just add a `--filter` prefix to the `pnpm` command. e.g: `pnpm --filter @nodejs-template/backend build`.
  But to be honest, most of the time it's preferred you run the script at the root of the project (if it's a command that other packages have). For example: Rather run `pnpm --filter @nodejs-template/backend build` it's much preferred if you run `pnpm build`. The reason being that since this workspace uses nx, if there's other dependent packages that also need their build phase to be run, it'll be run in order.

- To perform database related tasks like creating a new migration, you can make use of the `db` script available in the backend package. E.g: `pnpm --filter @nodejs-template/backend db migrate:make <migration_name>` would create a new migration in the migrations folder in the backend package.

### Deployment guide

The deployment strategy for this template is flexible and can be adapted to various environments. It is designed to be compatible with containerization (e.g., Docker) for easy deployment to cloud platforms or self-hosted solutions. Specific deployment instructions will depend on the chosen platform and tools.
